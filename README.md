# AngularJS Custom Search
This application is a simple integration of AngularJS and Google Custom Search www.google.com/cse to create a JavaScript-powered search tool.  This can be linked to any Custom Search engine and simply requires an API key.  

This demo was for a presentation to 50+ people and pulls data from the sites http://www.alphazeta.com/ and http://www.slackandcompany.com/.  A live version can be viewed at www.timpalac.com/projects/zetaslack.

The set up is pretty straight-forward:
- the initial app defines our routes and controllers
- views render our initial and return screens
- controllers and directives power each of those views
- services returns API data to the result controller
- and of course some html and css to round things out
